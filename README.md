# QuantDorsal
KavliQBio Toolbox to quantify Dorsal gradients

## Training Data
Test Training data can be found:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/m230rxmtnewq8cz/classifiers.zip?dl=0

Training datasets should be put in quantdorsal/classifiers/

## Ilastik
To tell QuantDorsal where ilastik is, one needs to edit configurations/paths
and enter the path to the ilastik binary. Note that this might be overwritten after
the next pull, since paths is also synced.

## TODO

- Align Dorsal gradient, map Intensities on eclipse (Map)
- Myosin
- Modeling
